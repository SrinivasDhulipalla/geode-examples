# Geode Lucene Index Example

This example demonstrates the use of a simple Lucene index. Lucene provides
a powerful text search and analysis. 

In this example, two servers host a single partitioned region with entries
that represent employee information. The example indexes the first and last
names of employees.

This example assumes that Java and Geode are installed.

## Set up the Lucene index and region
1. Set directory ```geode-examples/lucene``` to be the
current working directory.
Each step in this example specifies paths relative to that directory.

2. Build the example (with `EmployeeData` class)

        $ ../gradlew build

3. Run a script that starts a locator and two servers, creates a Lucene index
called ```simpleIndex```, and then creates the ```example-region``` region.
A Lucene index must be created before creating the region.

        $ gfsh run --file=scripts/start.gfsh

4. Run the example to populate both the Lucene index and `example-region`. The data
will also be retrieved from the region and printed to the console.

        $ ../gradlew run

## Try ```gfsh``` commands that interact with the region and do Lucene searches
1. Run a `gfsh` command to see the contents of the region

        $ gfsh
        ...
        gfsh>connect --locators=127.0.0.1[10334]
        gfsh>query --query="select * from /example-region"
        ...

    Note that the quantity of entries may also be observed with `gfsh`:

        gfsh>describe region --name=example-region
        ..........................................................
        Name            : example-region
        Data Policy     : partition
        Hosting Members : server2
                          server1

        Non-Default Attributes Shared By Hosting Members  

         Type  |    Name     | Value
        ------ | ----------- | ---------
        Region | size        | 10
               | data-policy | PARTITION

2. Try different Lucene searches for data in example-region

        gfsh> list lucene indexes --with_stats

    Note that each server that holds partitioned data for this region has the ```simpleIndex```. The Lucene index is stored as a co-located region with the partitioned data region.

     // Search for an exact name match
        gfsh>search lucene --name=simpleIndex --region=example-region --queryStrings="Jive" --defaultField=lastName

     // Search for a name that sounds like 'ive'
        gfsh>search lucene --name=simpleIndex --region=example-region --queryStrings="ive~" --defaultField=lastName

     // Do a compound search on first and last name
        gfsh>search lucene --name=simpleIndex --region=example-region --queryStrings="firstName:at~ OR lastName:ive~" --defaultField=lastName


3. Examine the Lucene index statistics

        gfsh>describe lucene index --name=simpleIndex --region=example-region

    Note the statistic show the fields that are indexed and the Lucene analyzer used for each field. In the next example we will specify a different Lucene analyzer for each field. Additional statistics listed are the number of documents (region entries) indexed, number of entries committed as well as the number of queries executed for each Lucene index.

4. Shut down the cluster

        $ gfsh run --file=scripts/stop.gfsh

5. Clean up any generated directories and files so this example can be rerun.
    
        $ ../gradlew cleanServer
